# Simple C Compiler using Lex

## Overview
This project implements a simple compiler for the C programming language using Lex. The compiler translates C source code into machine-readable code, providing a foundational understanding of lexical analysis and basic compiler design principles.

## Features
- **Lexical Analysis**: Utilizes Lex to perform lexical analysis on C source code, breaking it down into tokens.
- **Tokenization**: Identifies and categorizes tokens such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.
- **Basic Compiler Workflow**: Illustrates a simplified version of the compiler pipeline, including lexical analysis.
- **Educational Purpose**: Developed as a learning project to understand the fundamentals of compiler design and implementation.
